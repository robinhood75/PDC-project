## Getting started
Instructions to type in the terminal:

```bash
python transmitter.py  
client.py --input_file input.txt --output_file output.txt --srv_hostname iscsrv72.epfl.ch --srv_port 80  
receiver.py
```

To make a simple test quickly (could be used later to test transmission scheme efficiency). First ensure the _test.sh_ script has the correct permission with `chmod u+x test.sh` and then execute:

```bash
./test.sh
```
